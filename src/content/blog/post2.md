## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and simulation of **five classic network topologies** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Each topology follows standard networking principles and is built with appropriate interconnections, using switches, hubs, and routers as required.


The IP range utilized throughout the simulations is:

```

220.35.0.1 ‚Äì 220.35.255.255

```

Each topology was constructed with a focus on network design clarity, basic configuration, and operational connectivity.

## üßÆ IP Addressing Scheme

The IP addresses assigned begin from **220.35.0.1** and are distributed incrementally for each device in all topologies. Subnetting was not emphasized in this simulation-focused assignment but can be extended in future configurations.

## üï∏Ô∏è Simulated Topologies

### üöå Bus Topology

- All devices connected via a single communication line.
- Simple, linear layout using straight-through cables.
- **Pros:** Easy to implement for small networks.  
- **Cons:** Prone to collisions, no redundancy.

---

### üîÑ Ring Topology

- Devices connected in a closed loop.
- Each device forwards data to the next node.
- **Pros:** Equal access, predictable performance.  
- **Cons:** Single break disables entire network.

### üåü Star Topology (Switch)

- Devices connected to a central switch.
- High-speed transmission and easy device isolation.
- **Pros:** Scalable, easy fault detection.  
- **Cons:** Central device failure risks full outage.

---

### üåü Star Topology (Hub)

- Central hub broadcasts data to all devices.
- No switching intelligence, more collisions.
- **Pros:** Cost-effective, simple layout.  
- **Cons:** Less efficient than switch-based networks.

### üî∑ Mesh Topology

- Every device connects to every other device.
- Offers full redundancy and high fault tolerance.
- **Pros:** Resilient, multiple paths.  
- **Cons:** Complex, costly cabling.

### üå≤ Tree Topology

- Hybrid structure combining star and bus topologies.
- Hierarchical structure with layered connectivity.
- **Pros:** Scalable, manageable hierarchy.  
- **Cons:** Root or central failures can affect branches.
